## Overview

This repository is for project proposals for thenewboston digital currency. Funding will be provided for all projects 
or apps that meet the specified requirements.

## What You Will Be Responsible For

As project manager, you will be responsible for the following.

- Guiding the success of the project
- Building your team (we can help with recruiting)
- Managing all aspects of the project including planning, design, development, etc…
- Meet checkpoints according to your submitted roadmap timeline
- Maintain an active and happy team

## Build a Team

As project manager, you can choose to submit either an individual or team project proposal. If your project requires a 
team of contributors then you will be responsible for choosing your own team. If you would like help with recruiting 
for any positions whether it is designers, developers, quality analysts, etc... please post the role you are looking for 
in the #recruiting channel on Slack and our team will help you find a contributor.

## Funding

In your proposal you will submit the funds requested along with a timeline for the project. After reviewing the 
proposal, we can collaborate on a roadmap including a set timeline with designated check-in dates. On each of these 
dates you will be responsible for providing an update on the current status of your project. If the project is going 
well and has not been abandoned, we will release the funds to your account.
